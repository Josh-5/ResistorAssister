Welcome to the Resistor Assister! 


This is my submission for the VTHacks 9 hackathon. It can find the ideal
combination of resistors to get as close as possible to any resistance. 
I'm working solo for this hackathon, so the entire project was made from
scratch by me.

This project uses minimal add-ons. The only additional module imported is
the sys module to allow for the use of command line arguments

When running this program, run main.py with two arguments, the first being
the target resistance and second being the maximum number of resistors. Make
sure you also replace the resistances in resistors.txt with the values you
have available
